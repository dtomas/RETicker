*********** Version 0.4.5 **************************
This is a release. Finally after weeks of commenting an cleaning the code it looks now a little better than before. Not really a lot of new Features added, but you can see this on the wiki. Use it, and send bugreports or comments.

*********** Version 0.4.4 **************************
still waiting for a translation of Help.txt,

BIG JUMP:
*********** Update RETicker v 0.4.2  ***************
I didnt published any Versions between the others, but now
there is a new and revolutionary newsticker prog available ;)

New Features:
- command line parameters allow multiple instances with different
configurations
- age of news will be checked, therefore news will be cached and by checking
them the next time they will be compared to the news before, mightbe declared
as old
- lot of bugfixes and changes in code, but still no real code-cleanup done

Have fun.
Rene

the Programm: here it is. its still beta, and I'm working
on it. But its still useful, so use it ;)
